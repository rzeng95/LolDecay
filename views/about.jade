  p(style="font-size:18") LolDecay finds the date of your most-recent ranked solo/duo 5v5 game. Then, it subtracts that date from the current date to figure out how many days have elapsed since then. This value is then subtracted from 28 (for platinum and diamond accounts) or 10 (for master and challenger accounts) to determine how many days you have left until you decay.
